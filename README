With full permission of the previous author (Allan Odgaard) BetterLayers is
hereby released as free software under the MPL/GPL/LGPL tri-license. Please
read this license (COPYING) and make sure you understand the terms and
conditions of this license.

BetterLayers was compiled using StormC back in 1999, but is now targeted at
using the GCC compiler suite. Unfortunately, as of writing this file, the
current set of sources do not compile out-of-the-box, nor are they in any
way ready for a stable release.

BetterLayers actually never reached any release state until its sources where
believed to be lost due to a harddisk crash of Allan's machine. Now that the
sources are back, this project's effort is to bring BetterLayers back to
a workable state, address important issues and make it possible to integrate
features of BetterLayers into other Amiga compatible operating system. That's
the reason we choose the MPL/GPL/LGPL tri-license approach for the immediate
opensource release of BetterLayers

If you want to contribute to the development of BetterLayers please register
with SourceForge.net and notify one of the project admins of the TextEditor.mcc
project available at http://www.sf.net/projects/texteditor-mcc
