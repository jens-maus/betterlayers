    * initial CVS checkin of MPL/GPL/LGPL releases sources.

      NOTE:
      The current state of sources are more or less the original one from
      Allan. Back then he used StormC to compile the sources for m68k. This
      means that the sources do surely not compile out-of-the-box and I
      doubt they will. Also the library interface seems to be completly
       missing right now. There might also be redundant code passages/files
      which we are going to find out step by step. Also it is not clear
      whether the functions in "BetterLayersNG.c" are of any use as it seems
      that Allan wanted to start BetterLayers from scratch but was
      interrupted that time when his harddisk crashed.
      So to sum it up: The sources found here should be complete, but they
      definitly do not compile out of the box and they are also probably
      containing heaps of hided bugs. Ergo: We do have heaps of work now :)
